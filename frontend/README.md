# [Frontend] Freight Management System

## Description
The frontend of the Freight Management System is a React application built on top of the Domain Driven Design (DDD) architecture. The app provides a simple interface to manage freights. The main page of the app is the only one implemented, the rest of the sections are fake for demonstration reasons. All the CRUD operations for freights are implemented.
